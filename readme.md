# Pyros

A multi-platform python based GUI interface for the ancient but useful e-stim unit the ErosTek ET-312B.  

It is intended to run from a laptop or RaspberryPi.  

At the moment it gives a visual display of current settings and duplicates the knobs and buttons.  It could be expanded to run programs the way their proprietary connection software does.  I intended to broadcast via OSC to be received by an OSC client such as TouchOSC but for now a TKInter GUI will suffice.
